# Ren'Py for Nintendo Switch
This repository contains a port of [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) to the Nintendo Switch.  
Ren'Py is a visual novel engine that is written using [Python](https://www.python.org/).  
Discussion of this project is on the [Lemma Soft Forums](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=55503).  

## Building
Please view the `external_library_build/Building.md` file for instructions on building this project, including the additional third party dependencies.  

## File Formats
It is highly recommended that you use the following file formats:  

* WebP for image assets
* Opus/WebM for audio assets
* VP8/Opus/Matroska for video assets
* RPAv2 for game archives

If these formats are not used, there is a possibility of the program working incorrectly or performance being impacted.  
Free tools such as [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) are available to convert file formats.  
[rpatool](https://github.com/Shizmob/rpatool) can be used to create and merge RPA files, and also convert to RPAv2 format.  
The file format can be changed without changing the file extension, so no script (`rpy` file) changes are needed.  
The file `example.png` can be in the WebP file format without changing the filename to `example.webp`.  

## RomFS Integration
To integrate the game into one single `nro` file, place game files in a folder named `romfs`, and build as described in the "Building" section.  
NOTE: If you do not compile the `py` and `rpy` files to `pyo` and `rpyc` respectively by running the game at least once on a read-write file system, the loading time required until the title screen is seen will be increased.  
The `py_compile` module can be used to compile `py` files to `pyo`.  
Example usage of this module:  
```bash
find . -name \*.py -exec python -O -m py_compile {} \;
```

## File system layout
The following files or folders are required to be in the same directory as the `.nro` or in RomFS:  
* `lib.zip` - contains the Python stdlib, Ren'Py modules, pygame_sdl2 modules, and libnx binding modules.
* `renpy` - contains the `common` directory used by Ren'Py.
* `renpy.py` - startup script for Ren'Py.
* `game` - contains the game files. This is where you place the game.

## libnx bindings
Ren'Py for Nintendo Switch supports mostly complete [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) bindings.  
The bindings are generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).  

To use the bindings, you need to import the library `libnx`.  
```py
import libnx
```
To initialize a structure, you can use the following syntax:  
```py
clkrstSession = libnx.ClkrstSession()
```
To access members of a structure, you can use the following syntax:  
```py
service = clkrstSession.s
```
To access a enumeration, you can use the following syntax:  
```py
libnx.PcvModuleId_CpuBus
```
To call a function, you can use the following syntax:  
```py
libnx.clkrstOpenSession(clkrstSession, libnx.PcvModuleId_CpuBus, 3)
```

Example use cases of this feature:  
* Mounting game RomFS  
* Creating save data on the system memory  
* Opening a video in the web browser applet (with hardware acceleration)  
* Opening the software keyboard applet
